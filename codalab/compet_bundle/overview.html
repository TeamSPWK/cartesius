<H3>Welcome</H3>

<p>
	Welcome to the Cartesius competition, a competition hold by <a href="https://www.spacewalk.tech/">Spacewalk</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
	At SpaceWalk, our models are dealing with <b>geometries</b> a lot.
</p>

<p>
	But it's not trivial for a NN to learn a <b>good representation</b> (good features) of the input geometries.
    And if a geometry is not well-represented, it <b>directly impacts the quality</b> of the results.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
	In this competition, you will train a NN to learn good representation, by training the model to predict various properties of the given polygon, such as :
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Area</b></li>
    <li><b>Perimeter</b></li>
    <li><b>Size</b> <i>(on the x-axis and the y-axis)</i></li>
    <li><b>Concavity</b> <i>(concavity is a <b>ratio</b> that represents how much <b>concave</b> a polygon is)</i></li>
    <li><b>Minimum clearance</b> <i>(minimum clearance is the <b>smallest distance</b> by which a point could be moved to produce an <b>invalid</b> geometry)</i></li>
    <li><b>Centroid</b></li>
</ul>
